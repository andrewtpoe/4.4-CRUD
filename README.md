# 4.4-CRUD

This purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency manipulating a database in rails by creating and testing a functional "music manager" app. Users should be able to:
* Create a new record
* View all records
* View a detail page for a single record
* Update a single record
* Delete a record

### Update- 2015-07-10, 9:00pm

Styling is completely absent at this time, but all functionality is present. Users are able to view all records, view additional details on a single record, as well as create a new record, update an existing record, and delete an existing record.

### Update- 2015-07-11, 7:30pm

Added styling to site. Also refactored some of the code to improve functionality. CRUDdy now works and looks good!
